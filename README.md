# Master-Project

Live demo #http://127.0.0.1:5503/index.html

in this project the 2 API's I went with are currency conversion and World News

As for the currency conversion features I have;
1. Real time conversion rate
2. historical conversion rate
3. location based default currency (USD)
4. save favourite currency pairs
5. show favourite currency pairs
6. quick conversion feature
7. all currency can be converted to the user's demands

as for the world news features I have;
1. search for news
2. category specific news
3. country specific news (selected country)
4. Bookmars
5. shows tops news of the day
6. user can view bookmars
7. category filter

for this project I created 6 branches + the main, once i completed each branch with the features, i merged all the request to the main branch. once the
the merge was completed, I added addition features to the main branch (hence the additional commits and deployements)

I created my repo at first then cloned my repo using gitbash to my master-project folder

the challenges that i face were;
1. JavaScript Coding (features for each script were a small  complex)
2. which Api and where to find the API's

i got the api for the exchange here (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
i got the api for the world news here (https://newsapi.org/)

the easiest part of the master project was the html and the css coding

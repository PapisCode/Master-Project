            <p> This was a very challenging project, yet extremely fun. The sole purpose of this project for me
                was to see if I truly understood the concepts that I learned throughout the course. It was an
                incredible learning experience that allowed me to showcase my new skills and increase my final grade for this perticular course.
                I can easily say that my biggest challenge with this project and all other project was learning JavaScript language, especially understanding 
                the more complex features. Thanks to the Fundementals of JavaScript and Algorithm Problem Solving classes helped me enormously. I should also add 
                the countless hours spent watching tutorials, seeking help from the Profs, tutors, and experimenting with coding.
                Overall, this project has been extremely helpful with my coding journey, and I'm proud with what I was able to learn in the few months since I started this program.
